This is the first little game, created as a practice project. 
I used Godot, a free and open-source game engine, and programmed it in GDScript.
I used GIMP to sketch and animate my dog, which was a fun experience. 


My goal was to dive into the game development process and understand the resources and planning involved in creating a game.
Afterward, I understood why over 1000 people were needed to create a game like The Witcher 3.

I have another game idea in mind that I plan to work on in the future!
